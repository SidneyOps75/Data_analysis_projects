# Data_analysis_projects
## Introduction
Below you shall have a view of the data analysis  notes and projects. The projects will be contained in different files which will be demonstrated below. Anyone can use this as their roadmap in data analysis.
## Types of Variables
Categorical variables indicate membership in a particular group and have a discrete or specific qualitative value. They are further classified into two types:
   - Nominal - These are variables that consist of two or more discrete categories whose value is assigned based on the identity of the object. Examples are gender, eye color or type of animal.
   - Ordinal - These are variables that consist of two or more categories in which order matters in the value. Examples are student class rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd) or satisfaction survey scales (dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied).

Numerical variables are quantitative values:
  - Continuous - These are variables that are quantitative and can be measured along a continuum or range of values. There are two types of continuous variables: Interval variables can have any value within the range of values, and examples are temperature or time; Ratio variables are special interval variables where a value of zero (0) can mean that there is none of that variable and examples are income or sales volume.
  - Discrete - These types of continuous variables are quantitative but have a specific value from a finite set of values. Examples include the number of sensors activated in a network, or the number of cars in a lot.
