# Data_analysis_projects
## Introduction
Below you shall have a view of the data analysis  notes and projects. The projects will be contained in different files which will be demonstrated below. Anyone can use this as their roadmap in data analysis.
## Types of Variables
Categorical variables indicate membership in a particular group and have a discrete or specific qualitative value. They are further classified into two types:
   - Nominal - These are variables that consist of two or more discrete categories whose value is assigned based on the identity of the object. Examples are gender, eye color or type of animal.
   - Ordinal - These are variables that consist of two or more categories in which order matters in the value. Examples are student class rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd) or satisfaction survey scales (dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied).

Numerical variables are quantitative values:
  - Continuous - These are variables that are quantitative and can be measured along a continuum or range of values. There are two types of continuous variables: Interval variables can have any value within the range of values, and examples are temperature or time; Ratio variables are special interval variables where a value of zero (0) can mean that there is none of that variable and examples are income or sales volume.
  - Discrete - These types of continuous variables are quantitative but have a specific value from a finite set of values. Examples include the number of sensors activated in a network, or the number of cars in a lot.
## Static and streaming data
There are two types of data that analysts work with: static data and streaming data. Data that is received and stored prior to performing analysis on the data is considered static data. When each event is processed and analyzed as it is received and subsequent results are used or stored, the data is referred to as streaming data.
Consider data from a movie review site. A data analyst wants to categorize each viewer comment by whether it is positive or negative during the week a new movie was previewed. The analyst can treat the data as either static or streaming. If the data is going to be treated as static data, it will be stored in the database for later analysis at the end of the week. If it is going to be treated as streaming data, each entry in the comments will be analyzed as it is observed, in real-time. Often, the results of analysis of streaming data are represented as a continuously updated dashboard, or as input to an automated function.
## Structured file types
### Relational Databases
A relational database is a collection of tables with columns and rows that are connected by pre-defined relationships. These items are organized as a set of tables. Tables are used to hold information about the objects to be represented in the database. Each column in a table holds a certain kind of data, and each field in that column stores the actual value of an attribute.
### Logs 
Log files are a machine-generated historical record of everything and anything that happens within a system, such as transactions, errors, or intrusions. Log files are usually considered structured data, because they are machine-generated and so adhere to a standard format.
### Spreadsheets 
A spreadsheet file is an example of a flat file database. A flat file database stores records in a single file with no hierarchical structure. Spreadsheets are organized similarly to tables in a database, in that the data is organized into rows and columns, with related objects aligned either horizontally or vertically.
### Sensor readings 
Sensor output is usually collected in a standardized format, which may vary by manufacturer. Individual readings may be separated only by a delimiter or may be time dependent, such as 1 output per second, separated by timestamps.
### Transactional Records 
Records of transactions can be stored in many different formats, depending on the type of transaction and its source. Some transactions are entered manually into forms, while others can be machine generated.
